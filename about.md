I have been intrigued with computers and programming since it got first
introduced in school and has been on learning conquest since then.

Programming always presents a fresh perpective, no matter how many times you have
solved the same problem.

I started with C to learn the concepts and got introduced to **Ruby** to
strengthen my love and passion to move forward :)

Being lucky enough and used Ruby on Rails on big projects with huge
success but always relenting to do more to scale it (against the very
principle of Ruby - Developer Happiness). In the pursuit of alternative,
got introduced to **Elixir** and fell in love with it :)

My current areas of interest:

- Alternate architectures to MVC like CQRS/ES, Trailblazer
- Distributed systems and microservices
- Back-end programming
- Infrastructure, DevOps tools and practices

I like to blog and tweet my learnings to share and get critiqued ;)

In my free time, I like to play with my son and enjoy the pool :)
